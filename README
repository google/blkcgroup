The primary motivation for this test is to verify that the
control group based block layer isolation functions properly.

This test creates and configures control groups and launches worker
tasks in them, then evaluates how effective the isolation is.


Concepts
========
Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning
sets of tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups
with specialized behavior.

A cgroup hierarchy arranges cgroups in a tree so that resources can be
partitioned at multiple levels. Split hierarchies allow for separate
cgroup hierarchies per-resource for more flexible isolation.

See Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt in the kernel source for more
details.


Requirements
============
0. Kernel options.
This test requires a Linux kernel 2.6.26 or later.
The following Kconfig options must be set:
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_RESOURCE_COUNTERS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP=y
CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_CFQ=y
CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED=y

1. Blkio controller.
The blkio controller must be set up properly. This can be simply done:
  $ mount -t cgroup -o cpuset,blkio none /dev/cgroup

More thorough documentation is at Documentation/cgroups/blkio-controller.txt
in the kernel tree.

2. A relatively recent version of dd.
This test uses "conv=fdatasync" and "oflag=direct" arguments for dd,
which are available in recent versions of coretools.


Building the tests
==================
We have to make some binaries that the test uses.
$ make  # build a binary to service random read workers


Running the tests
=================
$ ./regression_test.py  # Runs a suite of coverage tests
or
$ ./mixed_cgroup_test.py  # Runs a short smoke test.

Test data is output to stdout. The very end of output will have a
summary line like:
"-----ran 34 experiments, 33 passed, 1 failed"

Searching for "FAILED" in the test output will tell you which experiment
failed (and by what margin). Passed experiments will indicate the
achieved DTF margin.

If you get errors about state left behind from the previous test, use
the -c flag:
$ ./regression_test.py -c
which deletes state left behind from interrupted tests. Specifically, it
deletes all containers prefixed with blkcgroupt.


Adding new tests/writing new tests
==================================
Creating tests is pretty straightforward; if an invalid experiment is
specified in the test, the harness will exit with an error. For example,
current kernels do not support cgroup weights that would give less than 10%
of disk time, so we can't run a test where workers would get 5% of the time.

The central part of the test is a list of experiments, strings that specify a
list of worker jobs, their corresponding weights of total cgroup weight,
and the permitted "error": the difference we tolerate between requested
weights and what is observed.

It's generally a good idea to work off of examples in the existing tests.

The current supported workers are:
	rdseq:      read sequential
	rdseq.dir:  read sequential (direct)
	rdrand:     read random
	wrseq:      write sequential (buffered)
	wrseq.sync: write synchronous (buffered)
	wrseq.dir:  write sequential (direct)

A full description of the experiment grammar is in
blkcgroup_test_lib.py.


In addition to the list of experiments, there are some arguments passed to the
test harness:
workvol: the volume where test files will be created.

seq_read_mb: Size in megabytes, of input files used for rdseq workers.
	     Scales the overall time duration of all tests. For instance, if a
	     container has N identical workers, each uses a separate file of
	     size 1/N. For other worker types, their input or output file size
	     is automatically scaled to a related size that takes roughly
	     the same elapsed time as does rdseq reading seq_read_mb.

TODO
====
We plan on adding new features to this test soon, including
  - support for split hierarchies
  - more worker types
  - more tests
  - better control over blkio settings, like group_isolation.
